# "The Motivation Hacker" book by Nick Winter

## Intro 


Analogy with chef's tools: every day tools + other but not core useful tools.

3 core tools:

* success spirals
* precommitment
* burnt ships


He proposes this pipeline:

1. Pick your goals
2. Figure out motivation hacks for each goal
3. Add "far more than you need, so that you not only succeed, but that you do so with excitement, with joy, with extra verve and a hunger for next goal."

## Motivation model

Core equation of the book (***MEVID***):

Motivation = (Expectancy x Value) / (Impulsiveness x Delay)

He defines the terms:


* **Motivation** - "fire, energy, excitement!". We want more of this.

* **Expectancy** - confidence of success. The lower it is, the lower motivation (though I suspect on the extreme the $motivation(expectancy)$ function is not monotonic).

"You can't do math / understand computers", "You don't think you can be happy" - bad examples of low expectancy, because those are skills that can be learned. "All of these things can be done with a little practice by almost anyone".

* **Value** - how rewarding the task (during process + when you finish it).


"Motivational hacker learns to steer his life towards higher Value and to have fun demolishing boring necessities in his way".


* **Impulsiveness** - aka distractability. "If there's nothing else you could be doing right now, then **Impulsiveness** is low and motivation high"

"Motivational hacker learns to anticipate and eliminate distractions and temptations, making it trivial to follow through with her plans".

* **Delay** - "how far off the reward could be". But even the author notes that "you can set yourself up to perceive Delay differently".

- "Junk food? Sure - it's not going to kill you tomorrow or anything"
- "It would take years before you'd be good at guitar / Japanese / physics / mathematics, so you don't want to practice".
- "The thought of eight years of medical school prevents you from becoming a doctor."

Important term related to **delay**: **hyperbolically discount rewards**.

"The motivational hacker learns to structure goals so that the perceived delay is not so great".


Tools:
- Intermediate milestones
- Process-based goals
- Willfully optimistic planning


## Willpower model

George Ainslie's definition: "the will is a recursive process that bets the expected value of your future self-control against each of your successive temptations."



## The first tool: "**Success Spirals**"

"success begets confidence and motivation, which begets more success"


"Once you've climbed several success spirals, you'll see those 'I cant' pits as the challenges they are: success spirals that just start a little lower."


"The important part is to never weasel out of doing what you said you'd do". OR your **Expectancy will take damage**.
